# Cafe-App
This is a project developed by me during my 7th semester. This project is based on idea of ordering breverage (i.e tea/coffee) , where user is allowed to select different specifications based on beverage. 
For example , for coffee we can select number of shots , type of milk etc and for tea user can select steeping time , temperature etc. 
Also there is a menu.txt file where a beverage is specified based on the ingredients and receipe. The code helps to match the beverage based on user requirements.
The order is placed on order.txt file.
